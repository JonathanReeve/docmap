This project, codenamed DOCMAP, is an open-source effort, spearheaded by NYU's History Department, to develop new themes and customization functionality for the Omeka content management system. 

##Contents of this Directory
This directory contains an Omeka theme named Pinstripe. 

##Installation Instructions
To install this theme, click the "ZIP" button above to download a zipped copy of this repository, or, from a terminal, change to your Omeka themes directory and run `git clone https://github.com/JonathanReeve/docmap.git pinstripe/` This command downloads the contents of this folder into a directory called "pinstripe" in your Omeka themes directory (probably /var/www/omeka/themes/pinstripe). 

##Features List
This theme is made with lots of experimental features, including: 
 * CSS3 rounded corners and transparent boxes
 * Jquery image overlays on item previews 
 * experimental functions to show image previews for collections and exhibits

##Requirements
 * Square thumbnails for your item collection at 200px, and regular thumbnails at 400px. Use the Image Resize plugin.
