description = "An elegant, buttoned-down theme based on the aesthetic of a pinstripe suit with a purple tie. Browse Items and Browse Exhibits views are image-centered, and fit more items on the page, at the expense of metadata. This theme works best by first running the Image Resize plugin on your images, to generate 400 pixel thumbnails and 200 pixel square thumbnails."
